<h2>Welcome to FLEA MARKET FLIP CUP Bingo</h2>
<h3>Pick one of the following Bingo Cards</h3>
<h4>(If you are in a group, you probably want to coordinate who has what card so you don't overlap.)</h4>
<h3>RULES</h3>
<h4>1. Everyone playing picks a bingo card!</h4>
<h4>2. Turn on some Flea Market Flip!</h4>
<h4>3. Whenever an item on your card happens, take a drink!</h4>
<h4>3a. If an item happens a second time, but for a different team or item, take another drink and keep the square marked.</h4>
<h4>3b. If marking a square results in a BINGO, then you can chug the rest of your drink.</h4>
<h4>4. Once your drink is empty, you have to play some classic flip cup!</h4>
<h4>5. The winner is whoever can successfully flip their cup first!</h4>
<h4>5a. If a bingo was achieved you must get a new card.</h4>
<h4>5a. Non-Bingoed cards can be carried over from episode to episode.  </h4>
